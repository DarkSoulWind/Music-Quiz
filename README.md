# Music Quiz
This is a console text game, made in C++, where the player has to guess the name of a song with its given artist and first letter of each word of its name.

## How to play
The gameplay is very simple:
- The player begins by entering their name
- They are then presented with the name of the artist, followed by their corresponding song
- The catch here is that only the first letter of each word of the song name is shown
- The user has two chances to guess the name of the song with the given information
- If guessed correctly once, the player gains 3 points; else they will gain 1
- The game ends when the player runs out of chances

This was a fun C++ project, since I'm not exactly great at programming.
